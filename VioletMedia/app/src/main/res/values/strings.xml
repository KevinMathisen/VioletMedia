    <string name="about">VioletMedia can be used to play local videos or stream them from an url.\n
\n
        You can add videos to play in two ways.\n
\n
    The first is by choosing a local videofile, which can be done by clicking the \"\.\.\.\" button in newVideo.\n
        \n
    The second way is by streaming it. You only need to paste the url of the video into the url field in newvideo.\n
        If the videoplayer only displays a black screen there is a problem with the url.\n
\n
    If you want to view subtitles with your video, you can enter the url of a subtitle file in the subtitle field. The subtitle file has to have the .vtt format.\n
